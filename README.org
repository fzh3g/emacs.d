* Introduction

This is zhengfaxiang's Emacs configuration tree. It contains some reasonable
config for better coding experience, which runs smoothly in my Archlinux. This
config adds improvments for the following languages:
- C/C++
- Python
- Fortran
- Matlab
- LaTeX

* Installation

To install, clone this repo to =~/.emacs.d=. Please backup your old
=~/.emacs= and =~/.emacs.d= before you join the journey :-)

#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/zhengfaxiang/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

Then just fire up your Emacs, further third-party packages will be
automatically downloaded and installed.

* Update

Update this config by entering =~/.emacs.d= and typing =git pull=. You
also need to update the third-party packages by:

~M-x package-list-packages~, then ~U~ followed by ~x~.

* Before you start

For fully enjoy the powerfull features of this configuration, there's
some recommended instructions:

** Spelling

- =flyspell= is used for automatic spell checking
- Install =aspell= & =aspell-en= or =hunspell= & =hunspell-en= through your
  system package manager

** Python

- [[https://github.com/tkf/emacs-jedi][emacs-jedi]] is used for auto completion. Install =jedi=, =service_factory=
  by =pip= or system package manager.
- Install =flake8=, =pylint= by =pip= or system package manager for syntax
  checking.
- Don't forget ~M-x jedi:install-server~ before using python-mode
- If you're coding with multiple versions of Python, install
  [[https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/][virtualenv]] through =pip install=. After modified your virtualenv, use
  ~M-x pyvenv-activate~ to activate it.

** C/C++

- [[https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode][irony-mode]] is used to improve the editing experience for the C, C++ and
  Object-C languages.
- Install [[http://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html][libclang]] and [[http://www.cmake.org/][cmake]] through your system package manager
- ~M-x irony-install-server~ to install =irony-server=
** LaTeX

Make sure TeX is installed. If you are a
- Ubuntu/Debian/Mint user, install texlive by
  =sudo apt-get install texlive-full=
- Arch Linux user, install texlive by
  =sudo pacman -S texlive-most texlive-langcjk=
- Fedora user, install texlive by =sudo yum -S texlive-all=
- SuSE user, install texlive by =sudo zypper in texlive-xetex=

** Searching

[[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][Ag]] (aka the silver searcher) is required by =helm-ag= for gorgeous code
searching experience.
