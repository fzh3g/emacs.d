#+TITLE: Naive Emacs configuration

* Introduction

This is my personal Emacs configuration I play with almost everyday.
I rewrote [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][Purcell's Emacs configuration]] with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] which makes it
faster and tidier. This configuration adds improvements
for the following languages or modes:

- C/C++
- Python
- LaTeX
- Org-mode
- Markdown

and some basic support for others like:

- Matlab
- Fortran
- Yaml
- Lua
- HTML/CSS
- VimScript (sometimes I use Emacs to edit =~/.vimrc= ðŸ˜„)

* Installation

To install, clone this repo to =~/.emacs.d=. Please backup your old
=~/.emacs= and =~/.emacs.d= first

#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/zhengfaxiang/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

Then just fire up your Emacs, further third-party packages will be
automatically downloaded and installed.

* Update

Update this config by entering =~/.emacs.d= and typing =git pull=. You
also need to update the third-party packages by:

~M-x package-list-packages~, then ~U~ followed by ~x~.

* Before you start

For fully enjoying the powerfull features of this configuration, there's
some recommended instructions:

** Fonts

=Monofur for Powerline= is used by default, you may need to refer to
[[https://github.com/powerline/fonts][here]] to install it. Or you can change it to whatever you like on
=lisp/init-fonts.el=.

** Packages

I personally use [[https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/elpa/][TUNA]] for faster package installing and updating. If you find
it slow, you may modify the =package-archeves= variable on =lisp/init-elpa.el=.

** Spelling

- =flyspell= is used for automatic spell checking
- Install =aspell= & =aspell-en= or =hunspell= & =hunspell-en= through your
  system package manager
- you can easily =C-.= to correct a word using =flyspell-correct-ivy=

** Python

- [[https://github.com/tkf/emacs-jedi][emacs-jedi]] is used for auto completion. Install =jedi=, =service_factory=
  by =pip= or system package manager.
- Install =flake8=, =pylint= by =pip= or system package manager
  for syntax checking with [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][flycheck]].
- Don't forget ~M-x jedi:install-server~ before using python-mode
- If you're coding with multiple versions of Python, install
  [[https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/][virtualenv]] through =pip install=. After modified your virtualenv, use
  ~M-x pyvenv-activate~ to activate it.

** C/C++

- [[https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode][irony-mode]] is used to improve the editing experience for the C, C++ and
  Object-C languages.
- Install [[http://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html][libclang]] and [[http://www.cmake.org/][cmake]] through your system package manager
- ~M-x irony-install-server~ to install =irony-server=

** Ag

[[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][Ag]] (aka the silver searcher) is required by =counsel-ag= for nice code
searching experience.

** IDL (Interactive Data Language)

Emacs support IDL with its embedded =IDLWave-mode= and =IDLWave-shell=. If
you are using IDL version 7.1, then you may have to do something within
your terminal to fix a warning:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sudo mkdir /usr/local/itt/idl71/help/online_help
  sudo ln -s /usr/local/itt/idl71/help/idl_catalog.xml \
       /usr/local/itt/idl71/help/online_help/
  sudo ln -s /usr/local/itt/idl71/help/idlithelp.xml \
       /usr/local/itt/idl71/help/online_help/
  sudo ln -s /usr/local/itt/idl71/help/template_help.xml \
       /usr/local/itt/idl71/help/online_help/
#+END_SRC

then open your Emacs and  =M-x idl-rescan-asynchronously=.
