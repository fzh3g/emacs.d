#+TITLE: zhengfaxiang's Emacs config

* Introduction

This is zhengfaxiang's Emacs configuration tree. It contains some reasonable 
config for better coding experience, which runs smoothly in my Archlinux. This
config adds improvments for the following languages:
- C/C++
- Python
- Fortran
- Matlab
- LaTeX

* Installation

To install, clone this repo to =~/.emacs.d=. Please backup your old
=~/.emacs= and =~/.emacs.d= before you join the journey :-)

#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/zhengfaxiang/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

Then just fire up your Emacs, further third-party packages will be
automatically downloaded and installed.

* Update

Update this config by entering =~/.emacs.d= and typing =git pull=. You
also need to update the third-party packages by:

~M-x package-list-packages~, then ~U~ followed by ~x~.

* Before you start

For fully enjoy the powerfull features of this configuration, there's
some recommended instructions:

** Spelling

- =flyspell= is used for automatic spell checking
- Install =aspell= & =aspell-en= or =hunspell= & =hunspell-en= through your
system package manager

** Python

- [emacs-jedi](https://github.com/tkf/emacs-jedi) is used for auto completion
- Install =jedi=, =service_factory= through =pip install=
- Don't forget ~M-x jedi:install-server~ before using python-mode
- If you're coding with multiple versions of Python, install
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
through =pip install=. After modified your virtualenv, use
~M-x pyvenv-activate~ to activate it.

** C/C++

- [irony-mode](https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode) is used to improve
the editing experience for the C, C++ and Object-C languages.
- Install [libclang](http://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html) and
[cmake](http://www.cmake.org/) through your system package manager
- ~M-x irony-install-server~ to install =irony-server=

** LaTeX

Make sure TeX is installed. If you are a
- Ubuntu/Debian/Mint user, install texlive by
  =sudo apt-get install texlive-full=
- Arch Linux user, install texlive by
  =sudo pacman -S texlive-most texlive-langcjk=
